/**
 * Name the provider on cash receipts that were left with a blank recipient.
 *
 * PaymentService counts `recipient IS NULL` towards "to Bookboll" on the
 * payments stats card. For Bookboll's own venues that is correct — Bookboll's
 * staff took the cash — and on this platform that is nearly all of them, so a
 * blanket backfill would move Bookboll's own money into the providers' column
 * and make the report worse. This only touches rows whose venue actually
 * belongs to a provider.
 *
 * Deliberately narrow, because "who took this cash" has to be beyond doubt
 * before a label is written:
 *
 *  - Cash only. Online money is split into its own commission and earning rows
 *    which carry their own recipients; a blank one there is a different bug.
 *  - Arrival balances only (`remaining` / `full`). A paid cash DEPOSIT is what
 *    the transfer reconciliation re-labels as Bookboll's fee, so guessing at it
 *    here would contradict that and is left alone.
 *  - Blank only. A recipient somebody already wrote is never overwritten.
 *  - Dry run unless --commit is passed, and safe to run twice.
