/**
 * What happens the moment the server stops recognising this session.
 *
 * Revoking a token from the admin panel only invalidates it SERVER side. The
 * browser carried on holding the stale token and the screen full of data it
 * fetched before, so every action after that quietly failed — a save that did
 * nothing, a list that never refreshed — and the operator had no idea they had
 * been signed out. Boot-time auth (initAuth) only ever covered the first load.
 *
 * So: the first 401 against an authenticated request ends the session here.
 *
 * Deliberately free of imports from auth.js / currentUser.js. Those modules
 * import apiFetch, and apiFetch has to call into this one, so importing them
 * back would close a cycle. Clearing the keys directly is also the more
 * dependable thing to do: the redirect below is a full document load, which
 * discards every in-memory store whether or not it had a reset function.
